But, data generated by a single organization is so much that it would be impossible for a team of humans to filter out the essential data from tons of raw data. Here is how data mining comes into the picture. Data mining is a process that organizations use to turn raw data into useful information. Organizations utilize software to analyze large sets of raw data and look for patterns. These patterns help organizations learn more about their customers or even the general public.</p>\n<p>This information pulled out helps to improve the decision-making process. Thus, strategies to increase sales, market, and deploy upcoming features are further apparent. Data mining is an indispensable part of any organization's intelligence. It helps perceive valuable insights by identifying patterns in raw data, thus turning them into useful information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Frequently data mining is confused with terms like machine learning and data analysis but, these terms are very different and unique. Data mining and machine learning both use patterns and analytics. Data mining looks for patterns that are already present in data. Patterns bought to light by data mining need human intervention to make decisions. Data mining gets patterns (information) from large datasets, and data analytics is when organizations decide to take this information and dive into it to learn more.</p>\n<p>Businesses that make use of data mining have an advantage. They have a better understanding of their customers, oversight of business operations, improved customer acquisition, and new business opportunities. Also, they acquire a perception of potential customers, new ways to market and improve their systems. Data mining helps businesses advance without any obstacles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data mining helps organizations with the detection of fraudulent activity and forestall potential fraud. Instead of relying only on the human experience, patterns generated from data mining can help you make a creative and innovative decision, one which might be beyond human analysis.</p><br>","related_post":[{"uid":"blt78029d51c24dc12a","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"seo":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","keywords":"","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"is_archived":false,"uid":"bltaf90ab20f1ef5cc4","created_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","updated_by":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","created_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:58.297Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T07:17:16.858Z","_version":3,"_in_progress":false,"intent_tags":{},"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3c32b327d39f9d8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-04-21T07:17:55.407Z","user":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","version":3},{"environment":"blt4ba664a020591f5a","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-04-21T07:17:55.406Z","user":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","version":3}]},"blt78029d51c24dc12a":{"title":"Traditional vs. Decoupled vs. Headless CMS – Know the Difference","url":"/blog/traditional-vs-decoupled-vs-headless-cms-know-the-difference","author":[{"uid":"bltad1da31b060199a5","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"date":"2021-02-07T08:13:44.000Z","featured_image":{"uid":"bltd2143f10431dff86","created_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:20.832Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:20.832Z","created_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","updated_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","content_type":"image/svg+xml","file_size":"53205","tags":[],"filename":"Image(1)_(2).svg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltf59c4e8f691cee51/bltd2143f10431dff86/602ff1ec491f743b146fe281/Image(1)_(2).svg","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blte7b941d2116a4503","_version":1,"title":"Image(1)_(2).svg","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3c32b327d39f9d8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-02-19T17:14:21.887Z","user":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","version":1},{"environment":"blt4ba664a020591f5a","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-02-19T17:14:21.887Z","user":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","version":1}]},"body":"<p>To understand and, more importantly, value the differences between traditional, decoupled and headless CMS platforms, you first have to let go of the idea that content management systems (CMS) are purely a marketing-focused tool. Managing the production, design and distribution of content has become a major function of most marketing departments. The marketing team has grown used to doing it all and being enabled to design and deploy a web page within their team. This is the case for a traditional CMS deployment and within large organizations the lack of governance in this model can prove troublesome.</p><h2>Traditional or \"Coupled\" CMS</h2>\n<p>There are clearly pros to doing it alone, but that ability has come with some rather serious drawbacks. For starters, pages need to conform to the database structure they sit atop. By extension, content needs to conform as well. Before you know it, content is being forced into structures that aren’t friendly, intuitive and may not perform to expectations. For all of the benefits of the WYSIWYG editor of the traditional CMS, it can only take an organization so far.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the traditional model was established for websites and was able to modify with responsive themes to adequately manage mobile, but there’s a world of change coming that won’t be satisfied with these systems. Also, traditional systems require components beyond the database, creating challenges for management and scale.</p><h2>Decoupled CMS</h2>\n<p>Demands for greater flexibility and scale have led to the concept of a decoupled CMS. In this world, marketers focus on creating content, and developers focus on the presentation of the content in the front-end. With this approach, the style and presentation of the content is not stored within the content, giving greater flexibility. Marketers do what they’re good at (content), and developers do what they know and love (coding).</p>\n<p>The downside to a decoupled approach is that the moment a front-end is chosen, the limitations of that choice are then baked into the solution. So while you’ve solved some of the limitations of the traditional approach, you haven’t solved all of them. You’re still in a world that’s tightly coupled to the past.</p>\n<p>This decoupled model, like the traditional model, hits its limitations when content needs to move quickly to cross-platform use cases.</p><h2>Headless CMS or API-First CMS</h2>\n<p>The need to have systems with even greater flexibility both now and into the future has given rise to another option headless CMS. There is some overlap with decoupled CMS in the sense that it allows for healthy separation between marketing and development needs. However, a truly headless model allows for the limits imposed by any coupled front-end to be thrown out . You end up with centralized model for content but a flexible and better-performing model for where content can go.</p>\n<p>This is because the Application Program Interface (API) approach of a headless CMS allows content creation to forever remain separate and distinct. Born in tandem with the explosion of API growth and the focus on microservice architecture, anything can call content from a headless CMS. Content becomes just another (but very important) service that can be called by a website, a mobile device, a software platform, an automobile, VR headset, Jumbotron or whatever tomorrow’s technology looks like.</p>","related_post":[{"uid":"bltd123fb52d828530d","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"},{"uid":"blt7baf129a37e621fe","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"is_archived":false,"seo":{"meta_title":"Blog","meta_description":"Blog data","keywords":"","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"uid":"blt78029d51c24dc12a","created_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","updated_by":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","created_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:56.250Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T07:16:43.122Z","_version":5,"_in_progress":false,"intent_tags":{"intents":{"newCustomer":{"str":50}}},"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3c32b327d39f9d8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-04-21T07:17:55.423Z","user":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","version":5},{"environment":"blt4ba664a020591f5a","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-04-21T07:17:55.423Z","user":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","version":5}]},"blt7baf129a37e621fe":{"title":"The transforming world of robotics","url":"/blog/the-transforming-world-of-robotics","author":[{"uid":"blt3f88a751d68665a4","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"date":"2021-02-09T08:10:18.000Z","featured_image":{"uid":"blt4424c2b9f7bcb25c","created_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:20.533Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:20.533Z","created_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","updated_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","content_type":"image/svg+xml","file_size":"32524","tags":[],"filename":"Image_3.svg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltf59c4e8f691cee51/blt4424c2b9f7bcb25c/602ff1eca89e364e939e5583/Image_3.svg","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blte7b941d2116a4503","_version":1,"title":"Image_3.svg","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3c32b327d39f9d8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-02-19T17:14:21.583Z","user":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","version":1},{"environment":"blt4ba664a020591f5a","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-02-19T17:14:21.583Z","user":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","version":1}]},"body":"<p>Envision a future where robots are so integrated into the foundation of human life that they become as common as smartphones.

In nature, an ecosystem includes living and non-living things that are connected to work together. In the same way, a cloud ecosystem consists of hardware and software but also includes cloud customers, cloud engineers, consultants, etc.</p>\n<p>A public cloud provider is at the center of a cloud ecosystem. It could be a PaaS or IaaS provider. From the center radiating are the software companies that use the cloud provider's anchor platform. It also includes consultants and companies that have an alliance with the anchor provider. Since the companies overlap to make a complex ecosystem, there is no vendor lock-in.</p>\n<p>New business models can be build using a cloud ecosystem. In a cloud ecosystem, it is easy to analyze data on how a new change or update might affect the other parts of the system. Cloud services are on a pay-as-you-go basis which, makes it efficient for customers. With all your resources set up in a cloud-based environment, it is easy to collaborate from anywhere in the world since these resources can be accessed over the internet, thus providing flexibility.</p><br>","related_post":[{"uid":"bltd123fb52d828530d","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"seo":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","keywords":"","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"is_archived":false,"uid":"blt30c84bd33713aec7","created_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","updated_by":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","created_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:57.270Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T07:14:12.522Z","_version":4,"_in_progress":false,"intent_tags":{"intents":{"existingCustomer":{"str":50}}},"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3c32b327d39f9d8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-04-21T07:17:55.447Z","user":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","version":4},{"environment":"blt4ba664a020591f5a","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-04-21T07:17:55.447Z","user":"bltd5d70bb484fce3ae","version":4}]},"blt246d7fc0c520171f":{"title":"The future of business with AI","url":"/blog/the-future-of-business-with-aI","author":[{"uid":"blt527f5ecbf4151430","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"date":"2021-02-08T08:15:16.000Z","featured_image":{"uid":"blt69b20e72092f87df","created_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:19.195Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T17:14:19.195Z","created_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","updated_by":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","content_type":"image/svg+xml","file_size":"47003","tags":[],"filename":"Images_(1).svg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltf59c4e8f691cee51/blt69b20e72092f87df/602ff1eb0c950353b0667b8e/Images_(1).svg","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blte7b941d2116a4503","_version":1,"title":"Images_(1).svg","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt4ba664a020591f5a","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-02-19T17:14:20.235Z","user":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","version":1},{"environment":"blt3c32b327d39f9d8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-02-19T17:14:20.235Z","user":"bltfa8f4cbde7d72d8a","version":1}]},"body":"\"Intelligence is not a skill itself, it's not what you can do, it's how well and how efficiently you can learn new things.\" <br>Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing out of research labs and into the business world.
